# Hand Tracking AI

A Python-based real-time hand tracking system using [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).  
This project builds on [this tutorial](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=computer+vision+AI+project+tutorial&mid=2F1675856E25992D398C2F1675856E25992D398C&FORM=VIRE) and extends it with additional features like gesture recognition and landmark distance measurement.

## **Features**

- Uses **Mediapipe** for real-time hand and landmark detection for multiple hands
- Visualizes hand landmarks and connections in the webcam feed
- Measure Euclidean distance between any two landmarks
- Detects simple gestures like **Thumbs Up** and **Thumbs Down** using landmark coordinates
- Easy to expand upon the gestures.
